Gross Description: A. Part A designated gallbladder. Received in formalin is a previously disrupted, deflated gallbladder, 7.8. x 3.2x 1.2 cm. The serosa is glistening, fatty pink and tan. There are two paracystic duct lymph node. candidates are 0.3 and 0.4 cm each. The cystic duct margin demonstrates a narrow 1 mm lumen, difficult. to probe for patency, however, upon sectioning does not appear obstructed. The lumen contains a. residual amount of viscous dark green bile without calculi; no calcull are present within the container. The. mucosa is velvety, dark green with few raised yellow flecks without grossly unusual areas of change. suggestive of neoplasia. Representative sections are submitted for microscopic evaluation, including. representation of the cystic duct margin (orange), lymph node, mid fundus and dome of fundus in A1. B. Part 8 designated common bile duct lymph node. Received In formalin is a rubbery pink and tan lymph. node candidate measuring 1.1 x 0.6 x 0,5 cm. The lymph node and surrounding fat is now bisected and. submitted together in B1. This report continues (FINAL). Printed: C. Part C designated Whipple procedure. Initially received in a fresh state for frozen section analysis is a. generous portion of tissue, consistent with a Whipple procedure specimen. Il consists of a distal portion of. the antrum of the stomach, 12.0 cm along the greater curvature and 7.8 cm on the lesser, and up to 7.0. cm in diameter at the proximal surgical margin of resection; the small bowel is 21.0 cm in length with an. average diameter of 2.5 cm and up to 3.1 cm at the proximity of the pancreatic head; the pancreas. includes the head and portion of the body 5.7 cm in length, 5.0 cm Inferior-superlor, 4.2 cm. anterior-posterior. The common bile duct is obscurred by peripancreatic fat, and extends out to 1.8 cm, is. markedly narrow, 0.35 cm diameter. The CBD probe patent to a depth of 2.5 cm. FINAL SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REPORT. The gastric and small bowel is now opened, and examination of the small bowel demonstrates prominent,. semi-congested pink and tan circular plica, with the apparent ampulla of Vater oriented 6,4 cm distal to. the pylorus, and Is obscured by a ralsed, dusky red lesion measuring 1.3 x 0.8 cm. The AV through the. pancreatic duct is probe patent. Several attempts to probe the AV with the common bile duct is. unsuccessful. The CBD and distal pancreatic margin are submitted for frozen section analysis, the residual. frozen tissue submilled en face for permanent sections. The pancreas is initially bisected through the. ampulla of Vater. towards the distal margin, revealing a poorly demarcated, dense, pink-gray tumor mass. measuring upwards of 3.1 x 3.0 x 2.2 cm, and grossly approaching within 2.8 cm of the distal margin of. the pancreas, and 2.8 cm from the common bile duct margin and grossly approaching within 0.5 cm of the. pancreatic notch/adventitlal margin. The length of the common bile duct is opened, revealing a light pink. and tan mucosa that is roughly kinked within the head of the pancreas, and routes parallel to the. pancreatic duct and inserts 0.3 cm from the pancreatic duct into the ""ampulia of Vater"". The tumor mass. approaches wilhin 0.5 cm of the edge of the CBD. The tumor is primarily oriented within the head of the. pancreas with discrete contiguous relationship with the ampulla of Vater. In addition, 2.0 cm proximal to the ampulla of Vater, the small bowel demonstrates a distincily raised,. granular area of density, that upon sectioning reveals evidence of an accessory duct with associated. firmness suspicious for tumor (C7-C8). The area appears to grossly approach within 0.5 cm of the superior. edge of the radial surface. 1.0 cm of the posterior surface. 0.3 cm of the Inferior surface, and 0.7 cm of the. anterior surface. The surrounding pancreatic parenchyma is admixed fatly and glandular, pink and tan. No additional tesions are appreciated along the small bowel length, however, the pyloric ridge. demonstrates raised granular changes. The gastric mucosa is wrinkled, erythematous light pink and tan,. however, abruptly transitions to severely congested, deep red-brown throughout the proximal two-thirds of. the gastric antrum. No additional lesions appreciated. Initial examination of the peripancreatic fat reveals twenty additional lymph nodes ranging from 0.2 cm. 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm each. Examination of the lesser and greater gastric fat does not reveal gross lymph. node content. The lymph nodes are entirely submitted for microscopic evaluation, with the specimen. retained in. solution to enhance future lymph node, identification if Indicated.

INTRA-PROCEDURE CONSULTATION: MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: THERAPEUTIC MARKERS. Test. Description. Breast Cancer Analvsis using Immuno-histochemistry,. 1. and Pathologist review. is a FDA approved adjunctive, computer-assisted and. interactive microscopy system which aids the pathologist in. the detection, classification, and counting of cells of. interest thereby standardizing slide scoring through. quantitative assessment of marker intensity, size and shape. Estrogen / Progesterone. Receptors ER/PR. ER = Rabbit Monocional Antibody (clone SP1). PR = Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (Clone 1E2). Anti-Estrogen receptor (ER) primary antibody is a rabbit. monoclonal antibody (IgG) that is used for the qualitative. detection of estrogen receptor antigens in sections of. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated. slide stainer platform used in conjunction with an indirect. biotin streptavidin detection system. The ER antibody is. directed against the epitrope present on human ER protein. located in the nucleus of norr. ind neoplastic cells. This. test is indicated as and aid in the management, prognosis,. and prediction of therapy outcome of breast cancer. Anti-Progesterone Receptor (PR) primary antibody is a rabbit. monocional antibody (IgG) that is used for the quantitative. detection of the A, B and C isoforms of human progesterone. receptor antigens in sections of formalin-fixed,. paraffin-embedded tissue on an automated slide stainer. platform used in conjunction with an indirect biotin. streptavidin detection system. This test is indicated as. and aid in the management, prognosis, and prediction of. therapy outcome of breast cancer. The significance of PR is. its role in determining the functionality of estrogen. receptors in breast cancer cells. The presence of estrogen. does not guarantee a response to endocrine therapy. One way. to evaluate the functionality of the ER present in breast. carcinoma is to determine if the proteins regulated by ER. are expressed. PR receptor is such a protein, and has. historically been-used to monitor the functionality of ER. The. measures the percentage of positively stained. nuclei of the tumor cells. Note: False negatives are possible. Positive staining for. receptor in the normal glands if present is a good internal. control, and increases the likelihood that a negative result. is a true negative. Ki-67 = Rabbit Monoclonal (clone 30-9). Anti-Ki-67 primary antibody is directed against the. C-terminal portion of the Ki-67 antigen, which is expressed. in the nuclei of proliferating cells (normal and. neoplastic). The antibody identifies proliferating activity. in sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue on. an automated slide stainer platform used in conjunction with. an indirect biotin streptavidin detection system. Assessment of tumor proliferative activity, IHC staining of. tumor cell nuclei, can be used for prognosis and therapy. planning. Ideal for use with small breast cancer specimens. The percentage of positively stained tumor nuclei is. reported. The. is an indirect biotin melhod. Interpretation utilizes the. instrument. The. is a. Tissue Fixation. ER/PR testing guidelines were released which include. fixation recommendations. All tissue should be fixed in. neutral buffered formalin as soon as possible. Excisional. and mastectomy specimen tissue should be fixed for a minimum. of 6 and maximum of 72 hours. For tissue not fixed within. the optimal time period or if fixation time is unknown it. should be noted on report. Any negative Her2 IHC result. without optimal fixation time should have Her2 FISH testing. performed. FISH, HER2/neu refl to IHC: CYTOGENETIC RESULTSCylogenetic. Reference #: Test Setup Date: est.

EXAMINATION: MRI BRFAST. .ATERAL \. Completed: FULL RESULT: Indication: Newly diagnosed left breast cancer. Comparison: Multiple mammograms dating back to. FINDINGS: Bilateral breast MRI was performed with and without contrast. CAD-stream. computer-aided detection system was utilized. to obtain multiplanar and 3-D reconstruction images. Subtraction images. were created from dynamic contrast data. All. images were evaluated at a work station. The right breast demonstrates no abnormal areas of enhancement or. adenopathy. On the left, axillary lymph nodes are more hypervascular than on the. right but morphologically they are similar and. symmetric. In the anterior upper-outer quadrant of the left breast, there is a. 1.5 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm irregular enhancing mass. consistent with the patient's known malignancy. Multiple scattered nodules are identified throughout the left breast. #1-3 cm superior, posterior and medial to the known malignancy is a. 6 x 5 x 7 mm enhancing nodule. Review of the. prior mammograms demonstrates that this was not present prior to this. year's mammogram and therefore is highly. suspicious for a satellite lesion. #2--Approximately 1 cm posterior to the known malignancy is a 3 mm. nodular area of enhancement. #3--2.3 cm inferior and lateral to the known malignancy is a 5 mm. nodule These are all suspicious for satellite. lesions. #4--In the far lateral aspect of the breast, there is a 1-2 mm. enhancing nodule. #5--Even more laterally, is a 3-4 mm enhancing nodule. This contains a. fatty hilum and these latter two nodules are. likely lymph nodes given their far lateral location and appearance. #6--In the posterior medial left breast a 3 mm enhancing nodule is seen. #7- in the far medial skin of the left breast there is a 4 x 2 x 4 mm. enhancing nodule. This could represent either a. benign or malignant skin tesion and therefore clinical correlation is. recommended. Interspersed between the known malignancy and the suspected satellite. lesions, are vague areas of subthreshold nodular. enhancement. A 1.6 and 1.4 cm area of this type of enhancement is seen in. the medial breast. Comparison of the MIP. projections show that these of. .Il areas of scattered enhancement and. nodularity are very asymmetric to the right and. therefore may relate to additional disease Inclusion of all of the. areas of enhancement shows that a large percentage. of the breasts may be involved with disease measuring up to 8.0 x 6.8 cm. Multicentric disease should be excluded. If breast conservation therapy. is considered, then biopsy of one or more of the. nodules will be needed. The 7 mm lesion, 3 cm from the known malignancies. (#1) would likely be visible by ultrasound and. amenable to biopsy. Some of the smaller more posterior nodules in the. medial breast may not be visible by ultrasound. IMPRESSION: 1. The patient's known malignancy is identified in the anterior. upper-outer quadrant and measures 1.5 cm. There are. multiple scattered renhancing nodules seen within the breast that are. suspicious for satellite lesions. Biopsies as. clinically indicated should be performed. HISTORY. Allergies: NKDA.

One is large, parasagittal in the superior left frontal, has. irregular enhancement, is probably extra axial, and is fed by a branch. of the. middle meningeal artery; this lesion is embolized. The second lesion. is. partially cystic, 5.5 cm across, and is located inferiorly in the. anterior. frontal lobe; the mass enhances slightly and exerts mass effect in the. lateral. ventricle. OPERATIVE DIAGNOSES. Brain tumors. Operation/Specimen: A: Brain, excision biopsy. B: Brain, 1, excision biopsy. C: Brain, intra-axial, excision biopsy. D: Brain, medial portion, excision biopsy. E: Brain, medial portion, excision biopsy. PATHOLOGICAL DIAGNOSIS: A and B. 1. Brain, sites not specified, excision: Meningioma (WHO I),. extensively. necrotic, previously embolized. 2. MIB-1 proliferation index: 2%. C, D, and E. Brain, intraaxial, medial portion (FS), and medial. portion-permanent, excision: 1. Glioblastoma. 2. MIB-1 proliferation index: 30% to 35%. See Microscopy Description and Comment. COMMENT. Parts A and B are portions of a fibrous meningioma that is extensively. necrotic. In the few better preserved areas the mitotic index is. about one /. ten high power fields, and the proliferation index is about 2% in the. more. active areas. There is not brain tissue in the specimens submitted. Parts C, D, and E contain portions of a glial neoplasm that heavily. infiltrates cerebral cortex and adjacent white matter. The neoplastic. cells. are very pleomorphic with frequent giant nuclei or multinucleated. cells. The. tumor has prominent nuclear anaplasia, frequent mitotic activity,. prominent. microvascular cellular proliferation, and zones of necrosis, some with. pseudopalisading. The MIB-1 proliferation index is high, up to 35%. The findings are interpreted as those of a glioblastoma (WHO grade. IV). In part C the tumor is more infiltrative. In parts D and E the. tumor is. more solid and less differentiated. PROCEDURES/ADDENDA. MGMT Promoter Methylation. Interpretation. POSITIVE: Methylated MGMT promoter is detected. lesults-Comments. Testing performed on DNA extracted from tumor paraffin block. TEST DESCRIPTION: Patients with glioma containing a methylated MGMT. promoter. have been shown to benefit from therapy with alkylating agents. Assessment of. MGMT promoter methylation status involves bisulfite treatment of DNA. followed. by real-time PCR amplification (MethyLight) of methylated and. unmethylated DNA. sequences. The analytic sensitivity of this assay was determined by. serial. dilution of methylated positive control DNA into unmethylated DNA, and. was. assessed to be 1% of methylated DNA in the background of unmethylated. DNA. Factors such as the presence of >50% non-neoplastic cells in the. sample, or. extensive tissue necrosis, may preclude the detection of methylated. MGMT. promoter sequences. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results. from a. stand alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its. performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA. regulations. It has not been cleared or approved. for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA. has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted. only in. the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. POSITIVE: Allelic loss on chromosome arm 19q is detected. Allelic loss on chromosome arm 1p is not detected. Informative loci are: D1S548, D1S1592, D1S552, D19S219, and PLA2G4C. Results-Comments. TEST DESCRIPTION: Allelic loss is assessed by PCR assay in Normal DNA. (baseline) / Tumor DNA pairs using 3 markers at both 1p and 19q. The 3. markers. on 1p are D1S548, D1S1592, and D1S552 (with D1S468, D1S1612, and. D1S496 as. backup markers) and the 3 markers on 19q are D19S219, D19S412, and. PLA2G4C. (with D19S606 and D19S1182 as backup) All markers are microsatellites. (2 or 4. nt repeats) except PLA2G4C which is a minisatellite (26 nt repeat). polymorphism. The markers were selected based on heterozygosity score,. amplicon size, and ease of interpretation. The backup markers are used. if the. first line markers at that chromosome arm are uninformative or. otherwise. ambiguous in their interpretation. LOH at all informative loci on each. chromosomal arm represents the typical finding in oligodendrogliomas. with 1p. and 19q deletion. FDA COMMENT: The above data are not to be construed as the results. from a. stand-alone diagnostic test. This test was developed and its. performance. characteristics determined by the. laboratory as. required by CLIA. regulations. It has not been cleared or. approved for. specific uses by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) . The FDA. has. determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These. results are. provided for informational purposes only, and should be interpreted. only in. the context of established procedures and/or diagnostic criteria. TECHNICAL SENSITIVITY: The presence of >15% non-neoplastic cells in. the sample. may preclude the detection of allelic loss. INTRA-OPERATIVE CONSULTATION. A.

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY: The meningeal tumor has positive reaction with EMA. With the MIB-1,. the. proliferation index is about 2%; around zones of necrosis, it may be. somewhat. higher, as may be expected in tumors with embolization-induced. necrosis. In the intra axial tumor, the GFAP demonstrates a dense gliofibrillary. background throughout the specimen, even in the more cellular, less. differentiated zones of the neoplasm. The synaptophysin and. neurofilament. depict the tumor densely infiltrating cerebral cortex and adjacent. white. matter, and absence of a neuronal neoplastic component. The great. majority of. neoplastic cells strongly over express the p53 protein. With the MIB-. 1 the. proliferation index ranges between 30% and 35% in the more densely. infiltrated. areas.
