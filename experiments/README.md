The survival experiments are documented at the top of the Jupyter notebook in this directory: [survival-experiments.ipynb](1-survival-experiments.ipynb).

Our experiment for correction of summary hallucination is also done in the main notebook but requires first sampling of reports ([hallucination-sampling.ipynb](2-hallucination-sampling.ipynb)) and manual correction ([comparison tool](../tools))
